The longer hammers could be used as polearms to fight cavalry and other opponents from longer range, and the shorter ones were used as close combat weapons, which was effective against armoured opponents.</p>

The elastic string is loaded with the arrow, pulled back and let go, releasing the arrow. This principle lies behind the mechanism of most types of bows. The crossbow was slightly different, as the shooting process was easier and the ammunition changed from arrows to bolts. The longbow is a taller version of the normal bow. The increase in height allows for less effort and more power for every arrow used.</p>
